      Why I Love Them

    <p>
      Sunflowers are my personal favorite flowers. My parents used to always grow them in our backyard and they would always grow so high. The tallest sunflower that ever grew I believe was about 30 feet tall! That's taller than any human! But to get that tall they need a lot of sun, at least 6-8 hours of sun a day.
